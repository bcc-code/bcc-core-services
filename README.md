**Important info - all commits pushed to the master branch will trigger a release to production. Be aware while merging PRs.**

## Creating a pull request

1. Create a pull request with a description [Keyword] + [Issue number] (`Closes #600` or `Fixes #600`) for bcc-myshare repository. <br>Use `Closes bcc-code/bcc-collections#40` to link to an issue in another repo, bcc-collection repository in this case.
2. Ensure that a project is select for the pull request
3. (Important) Select `Incident` label for bugs that affect end-users and are introduced in the production (master branch)*

# KPIs
We use [Haystack](https://dash.usehaystack.io/app/overview) to measure our speed and quality. It is based on the pull requests so it is important to build-in that in our routines and culture. **Only the pull requests count**, everything else is working automatically/out-of-box.

Four key metrics:
1. Lead time
2. Deployment frequency
3. Time to restore
4. Change failure rate
