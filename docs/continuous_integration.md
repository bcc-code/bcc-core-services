# Continuous Integration (CI)


## General rules
1. Start implementation with tests to cover all use cases (TDD approach)
2. Start with defining all use cases in a test file before filling up a method's body with an implementation.
3. Business logic needs to be 100% covered by tests

## Types of tests
Depending on different use cases we may use following types of tests.

### Unit Tests

### Integration Tests
1. Use WebApplicationFactory for .NET [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
### E2E tests

### Manual testing
