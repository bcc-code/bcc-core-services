Observations

# GCP and Azure pricing for egress are in the same ballpark
# Azure has slightly higher monthly costs for FrontDoor (330kr) than GCP has for Load balancer (275kr)
# GCP pricing is split accross multiple resources - harder to get an overview


# Deploying accross multiple resource groups requires extra security configuration setup in Azure


Can't access container registry, container app environments etc. accross subscriptions

Frontdoor took a little while to update / be live

Automation seems more mature in Azure
